POL_Constitution_of_May:0 "Constitution of May 3"
POL_Constitution_of_May_desc:0 "Adopted on the 3rd of May, 1791, the Constitution stands as the crowning achievement of the Commonwealth’s reformers. It seeks to heal the nation’s long decay — abolishing the liberum veto, strengthening the monarchy, and granting the people a new hope for good governance."

POL_new_constitution:0 "The New Strong Constitution"
POL_new_constitution_desc:0 "The government has come to understand a bitter truth  the Commonwealth stands surrounded by foes, and foreign influence has long weakened our will. To preserve our sovereignty, we can no longer cling to the old ways.A new constitution must give strength to the Crown, and purpose to the nation. Only through reform and resolve shall we defend our motherland and ensure that the Commonwealth endures as a free and independent state."

POL_small_army:0 "Disorganized Forces"
POL_small_army_desc:0 "The once-proud armies of the Commonwealth now stand scattered and ill-prepared. Years of neglect, empty treasuries, and noble squabbles have left the regiments understrength and poorly supplied. Officers feud over titles while the soldiers march in rags, their loyalty tested by hunger and doubt.    The motherland faces peril, yet her defenders lack the unity and order needed to meet it."

POL_small_army_reforms:0 "Army of Renewal"
POL_small_army_reforms_desc:0 "Under the guidance of the reformers, the Commonwealth’s army begins to recover from its long decay. The regiments are drilled anew, new officers rise from merit rather than birth, and the arsenals stir with life once more.Yet the road to a modern force is long and uncertain — the motherland’s soldiers fight with courage, but their arms and discipline are not yet the equal of their foes.                           Reformed in spirit, but not yet in strength."

POL_new_begining:0 "A New Beginning"
POL_new_begining_desc:0 "The first light breaks over the Commonwealth. Our efforts have restored order and given new life to the realm, though much remains to be done. The wounds of past neglect still ache, and our strength is not yet whole.Yet in the hearts of our people stirs a quiet hope — that this fragile dawn may grow into a lasting day.        The motherland rises, though her steps are still unsteady."

POL_panic:0 "Panic across Country"
POL_panic_desc:0 "Panic across Country,after second partition,banks and goverment dosent work well"
