 authoritarian_democracy_desc: "Dantonism represents a pragmatic fusion of democratic principles with concentrated executive authority. Named after Georges Danton, the revolutionary who sought to bridge radical and moderate factions, this ideology embraces popular sovereignty while maintaining that decisive leadership is essential during times of crisis.\n\nDantonist governments operate through elected assemblies and maintain constitutional frameworks, but grant extraordinary powers to strong executives who claim to embody the national will. They justify authoritarian measures as temporary necessities to preserve the republic from external threats and internal disorder. Civil liberties exist, but are frequently curtailed in the name of public safety and national security.\n\nThese regimes often emerge during periods of upheaval, when populations demand both representation and stability. The Dantonist leader portrays themselves as the people's champion—tough enough to make hard decisions, yet accountable through managed democratic processes. Elections occur regularly, though opposition faces significant obstacles and the ruling party maintains overwhelming structural advantages."
